# Animal-Gifs

This app displays animal gifs by accessing the Giphy api. When an animal button is pressed 10 gifs are displayed with the rating of each gif. The user can also add their own button by typing an animal into the input field.

When the gifs are loaded, clicking on a gif will make it play, and clicking again will pause it.
